As Cornwall Wargames Association, we predominantly play miniature wargames in a verity of settings: historical, fantasy and Sci-fi (sometimes an amalgamation of all three!) in a chilled out setting. This is not to say we only play miniatures games, as there is also a strong board game following, usually played after bigger games have finished.

The following is a small selection of games you can usually find going on at the club.

## Warhammer 40,000
Collect incredible armies of miniatures representing armies from the distant future, then recreate the brutal clash of 41st Millennium warfare in tabletop games of strategy and luck for two or more players. Each aspect of the Warhammer 40,000 hobby is hugely rewarding and satisfying in its own right. Build and paint your collection as you choose, to represent one of the iconic forces of the far future, or one of your own invention.

Your army can be whatever you want it to be: legions of infantry, powerful heroes, formations of tanks, demonic and alien monsters or titanic lords of war.

Play missions across battlefields of your own creation where no two games need ever be the same. Battle competitively at local gaming clubs, in our stores, at one of the thousands of tournaments that take place across the world each year, or forge a narrative with a battle or campaign that embraces the vast and limitless options offered from one of the richest and most expansive settings in all of fantasy and science fiction.

Welcome to the 41st Millennium.

## Bolt Action
From Blitzkrieg to North Africa, from the Russian Front to the D-Day Landings, Bolt Action puts YOU in command of the most brutal and famous battles of the Second World War.

Assemble and paint your brave men and armoured tanks, field them on a table-top battlefield, and use all your strategy, cunning and luck to defeat your opponent.

## Chain of Command
Chain of Command are the revolutionary new wargames rules designed for platoon sized actions with some additional support. The rules are fast paced, exciting and fun, using the unique command and control system which presents the player with the battlefield decisions made by his historical counterpart. These are the rules Neil Shuck of Miniature Wargames described as “probably the best set of Skirmish rules I’ve ever played”.

At 104 pages, the book includes the rules, a scenario generation system and Army Lists for Britain, Germans, the United States and Soviet Union, a system allowing the gamer to select support depending on the scenario being played, so you can pit two well matched forces against each other for a fun and challenging gaming experience.

## Star Wars Legion
Warfare is an inescapable part of the Star Wars universe, from the blow dealt to the Rebel Alliance in the Battle of Hoth to a few Rebel strike teams taking on a legion of stormtroopers stationed on Endor. Seize your chance to get your boots on the ground and lead your troops to victory with Star Wars™: Legion, a miniatures game of thrilling infantry battles in the Star Wars universe!

Star Wars: Legion invites you to join the unsung battles of the Galactic Civil War as the commander of a unique army filled with troopers, powerful ground or repulsor vehicles, and iconic characters like Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker. While innovative mechanics simulate the fog of war and the chaos of battle, the unpainted, easily assembled miniatures give you a canvas to create the Star Warsarmy you’ve always wanted to lead into battle—whether you fight for the monolithic, oppressive Galactic Empire or the ragtag Rebel Alliance.

Saga Historical / age of magic
SAGA is a skirmish game set in heroic ages whether they be historical, mythological or fantastical. It brings to life battles between exceptional warriors - Warlords who defy their enemies on the battlefield at the head of their loyal Warband.

The game puts you at the head of such a warband - 30 or so figures, lead by your heroic alter-ego, the Warlord. Each Warband uses a Battle Board and SAGA Dice to grant them various abilities in battle and reinforce their identiity.
