_Cornwall Wargames Association_ is a friendly club that plays a variety of games every other Sunday at the Village Hall in Quintrell Downs. The club runs all day, starting at approximately 09:30 and finishing at 17:00 meaning that big games, that cannot be normally be achieved in an evening, are totally possible here! 

Unfortunately at present, we cannot allow under 18’s to join, however they are welcome to attend with an adult member. 

We would be glad to welcome you to our next club meeting. The Village Hall can be found at: 

North Way, Quintrell Downs, Newquay, Cornwall.

## Key Members - The COMMITTEE
As with most clubs, we have a Chairman, Treasurer and Secretary who oversee the administrative aspects of the club, and who run the AGM on the first meeting in December. The AGM is also where other members of the club vote on various aspects of how the club is run, and at the relevant time elect a new Chairman, Treasurer and Secretary. A Chairman is elected every year, with the Secretary and Treasurer remaining in post for two years before being elected.
