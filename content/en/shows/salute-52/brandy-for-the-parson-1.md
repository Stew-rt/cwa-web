A smuggler racing game for 6 players. Find us at [Salute 52](https://southlondonwarlords.co.uk/next-salute) on Stand GF10

A consignment of fine French brandy was on its way to the smugglers favourite landing spot at Lyfsah Beach. That damned excise man Lt Pigeon spooked the crew on board the boat, and they have dropped the barrels out to sea just off Anthony Head.  Worse still, instead of lashing the barrels together to form a raft, they have either just thrown them overboard or the knots haven’t been tied properly.  Now the barrels are starting to spread far and wide and so must be recovered before the tide turns and they head out into the Atlantic. 

If Lt Pigeon appears you will have to take the barrels into Porthole itself as the beach will be compromised.

Get your crew together and head for the open sea…

## The Smugglers

The six boats taking part are:

**Black Chough**:  Owned by Sir Penrose Trenance-Crabbe. Said to own the largest black treacle mine in Penkneechew. 

**Blue Bonnet**: One of two boats hailing from St Angreevsey. Was sometimes used to deliver the post in an attempt to appear honest.

**Flying Turk**:  Owned by the Landlord of the Saracens Head in Poltacks. Has gone through many coxswains as they keep getting caught.

**Green Gull**: The smoothest boat on the north coast. A favourite of the ladies of Trebormince. Lock up your daughters!

**Red Ruth**: Named after the auburn-haired barmaid of the Jamaica Inn. Not the famous one, but the smaller establishment in Pensillcase.

**Yellow Maid**: Possibly owned by a member of the Kings council but no-one is saying. It’s slightly heavier than the other boats as it keeps being repainted.
