> "I Doubt not but you will, both from Gazettes, and Letters hear of the great Calamity that hath befallen this Island by a terrible Earthquake, on the 7th instant, which hath thrown down almost all the Houses, Churches, Sugar-Works, Mills and Bridges, through the whole Country. It tore the Rocks and Mountains, destroyed some whole Plantations, and threw them into the Sea, Port-Royal had much the greatest share in this terrible Judgement of God. I will therefore be more, particular in giving you an account of its proceedings in this Place, that you may know what my Danger, and how unexpected my Preservation."

**Port Royal** is a campaign based, tactical, small-scale warband-sized skirmish wargame that is easy and fast to learn and play. Loosely based on the historical events following the 1692 earthquake that devastated the island of Jamaica. In **Port Royal**, players take control of small companies of pirates, privateers, Native Americans, African Maroons, or local government forces as they battle against opponents for their share of the plunder that litters the ruins of the place. Players will gain loot and experience between games while building infamy and growing in their piratical expertise. But take heed! The ruins are fraught with dangers! Falling buildings, wild animals, desperate civilians, and opposing companies can bring a quick end to members of your company.
