And there it was, gone.

The club enjoyed a successful trip to Salute 51 at the Excel Centre, London on the 13th April 2024.

What a weekend! Many hours spent crammed in a minibus with months of hard work rattling noisily over every imperfection in the road all well worth it for our second club trip to Salute.

We made it into the hall to set up on the Friday with minutes to spare; anxious show organisers did their best to chase us straight back out again as soon as possible but mission accomplished. Boxes and boards dropped off ready for set up in the morning.

After a bit of liquid refreshment and a frankly embarrassing number of mixed grills we retired ready for a full on Saturday at the ExCel.

The Gallants of Fowey set up and ready for action.


On the day we made our way to the hall amused to see some eager chaps already queueing to get into the queue. Fun is serious business and takes dedication.

Game set up was straightforward. We were like a well oiled machine except all the bits have come loose and get in each other’s way constantly. There was even a comfortable amount of time for a wander before the doors opened.

Overall the game was very well received and we were thrilled and flattered by the consistent level of interest and kind comments throughout the day.

To cap off an excellent show we were awarded Best in Show which was a very pleasant surprise! Thank you to all of you who visited our stand, asked questions, and joined in the game throughout the day.


Winner winner chicken dinner - a true club effort!




Now to figure out what we’re going to do next year!
