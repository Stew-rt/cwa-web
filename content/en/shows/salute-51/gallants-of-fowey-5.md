## The game
With so little actual information available to stage the game we have been forced to invent our own scenario.

The French have been in the estuary for three weeks, and are beginning to run out of options. They have stolen anything movable but all their attempts to head inland for more plunder have been thwarted by the deep Cornish lanes seemingly full of cut-throats.

Being outnumbered, the pirates moved up river towards Lostwithiel into much shallower and narrower water. Initially the French tried to follow but came under attack from the riverbanks by archers using fire arrows. Discipline dissolved and the French hastily retreated back to the relative safety of Fowey Harbour.

The English have at last assembled a relief force and this has headed down the channel from Plymouth. However bad weather hit and only the vanguard of this force has arrived off the coast at Fowey. Undeterred and full of bravado they decide to press on into the estuary. Having been alerted to the imminent arrival of the relief force the pirates have come back down the river to help retake their town. A few boats have managed to slip past the French guard ships and are heading for the harbour itself. Although they are few in number they hope to cause as much fear and confusion as possible.

Will the French be trapped in the harbour or break out to make it back across the channel with their plunder?
